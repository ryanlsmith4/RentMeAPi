# RentMeAPI
## ABOUT

This API allows users to sign up to Host Rental Listings

Makes it easy for people to connect and find tenants

As this is a work in progress it still lacks valuable features such as searching for listings

Currently all the listings are in one place and that is the '/' route

This API currently can C.R.U.D listings and allows you to sign up for the app.

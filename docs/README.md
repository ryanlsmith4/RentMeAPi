# RentMeAPI
## ABOUT

> This Api allows users to sign up to Host Rental Listings

>Makes it easy for people to connect and find tenants

>As this is a work in progress it still lacks valuable features such as searching for listings

> Currently all the listings are in one place and that is the '/' route
